# LifesCoin (December 2019)
This is a past version of the team-project (with Danny Silvestre) from December 2019. 

The site is a social network that ranks content through the exchange of a virtual social currency. Users can give coins to posts (which last 24 hours) they like, ranking the post higher in its group and giving the post's owner that ammount. They can also add friends, private chat, post pictures to their own profiles, and create/join groups.

The full deployed project can be found at: https://www.sebastianllerena.com/lifescoin-site/login.php
